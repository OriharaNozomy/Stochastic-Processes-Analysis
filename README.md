# Stochastic-Processes-Analysis
This project represents an analysis of the Stochastic Processes using 2 input types:
->A file from the user with ensembles
->or a cos function represented as A*cos(4pi*t+theta) where the random process here could be the A(amplitude) or the theta.
Attached is the code and an example for an input file.
